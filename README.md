# TorrentScraper

This project helps me to learn / improve differents things.
With it, I practice Kotlin, and I discover TornadoFX, Couroutines, HTTP concepts, Unit Tests, ...

The main goal of this application will be to access torrent data from a software GUI.

Multiple features will be implemented.
